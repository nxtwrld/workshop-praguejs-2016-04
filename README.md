You will need to run this on localhost.


// Install a simple node server
npm install http-server -g

and run
http-server -a localhost -p 80


If you have Python installed, you should have a server available

You can try running
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

or add portnumber like 8080 to avoid conflicts
python -m SimpleHTTPServer PORTNUMBER
